# Things we should do

I lack time for obvious reason to implement all features. Missing features are:

- improve code coverage with new unit tests notably on component templates
- add e2e tests
- Save search criteria in url
- Simulate auth and implement a richer guard for the admin module
- Add opportunity to degrade goods quality
- Allow a customer to add some items to a shopping cart
